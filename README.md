# Twitter clone

This is my take at making Twitter clone. The project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Functionality

The functionality that the app has: 1. You can login with Firebase Google Auth, 2. You can post a tweet, 3. You can post an image, 4. You can comment, 5. You can retweet, 6. You can like a tweet

## Stack

    1. HTML, CSS, JS,
    2. React JS,
    3. Firebase Google Auth, Firestore, Realtime Database,
    4. Material-UI,
    5. using .env for hiding Firestore Config Data.
